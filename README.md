## **Cards against humanity**

This project is a practice projects during the CodeCademy course "Fullstack engineer". This is the first portfolio project in my software engineering career. 

### **Project summary**
The project "Mixed messages" or as I call it "Cards against humanity" takes a randomized beggining to a sentence and randomizes another part of the sentence that creates a full sentence. These could be very random and is quite fun to do with friends.

#### **How**
The code randomizes two different strings from to different arrays. One of the arrays is the "black deck" or the beginning of the sentence while the second part of the sentence is called "white deck". These two sentence parts are then combined to form a complete sentence with an other method in the generateSentence() object.
